Workplace engagement refers to the level of commitment and enthusiasm an employee has towards their work and organization. Engaged employees are more likely to be productive, innovative, and loyal to their employers. They have a sense of purpose and connection to their work and feel valued by their employer.

Workplace motivation refers to the drive and energy an employee has to perform their job to the best of their abilities. Motivated employees are more likely to be focused, goal-oriented, and committed to achieving their objectives. Motivation can come from both intrinsic (personal satisfaction) and extrinsic (rewards and recognition) factors.
