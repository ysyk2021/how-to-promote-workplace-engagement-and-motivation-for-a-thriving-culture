Leaders who prioritize employee well-being, recognize and reward employee contributions, and provide opportunities for career development are more likely to create an engaged and motivated workforce.

Leadership support is also important for creating a culture of trust and open communication, where employees feel comfortable sharing feedback and ideas. By regularly communicating with employees and soliciting their input, leaders can gain insights into what motivates and engages their workforce, and adjust their strategies accordingly.
